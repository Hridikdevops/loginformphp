Problem Statement

Introduction:
In the contemporary landscape of web application development, there is a growing need for a
secure and scalable solution that integrates user authentication with a backend database. Many
projects often face challenges in implementing a seamless user authentication system that
securely stores user credentials and allows for efficient interaction with a relational database.

Problem Description:
The absence of a standardized and easy-to-implement solution for user authentication and
database interaction leads to project delays, security vulnerabilities, and inefficient use of
development resources. Existing solutions may lack flexibility, robustness, or clear
documentation, making it challenging for development teams to integrate authentication
seamlessly with a MySQL database.

Objectives:
Our project aims to address these challenges by creating a PHP web application that provides a
secure user authentication system tightly integrated with an AWS RDS MySQL database. 
The primary objectives include:

Develop a PHP application capable of handling user registration, login, and password
management securely.

Dockerize the application to ensure consistency across different environments and streamline
deployment.

Set up and configure an AWS RDS MySQL database to store user information securely.

Create a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline that automates the building, testing, and deployment
processes.

Facilitate easy integration of the application into other projects by providing clear documentation
and guidelines.

Target Audience:
This project caters to web developers, software engineers, and development teams working on
PHP-based web applications. It is designed to simplify the process of implementing secure user
authentication and database interaction within their projects.

Scope:
The scope of this project covers the development of a PHP web application, Dockerization of
the application, integration with AWS RDS for MySQL database storage, and the establishment
of a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline.

Constraints:
Project development is subject to constraints such as limited budget, resource availability, and
the need for compatibility with PHP and MySQL.

Benefits:
Upon successful implementation, this project will offer a standardized and secure solution for
user authentication and database interaction, promoting faster development cycles and
improved security practices.

Success Criteria:
The project's success will be measured by the seamless integration of the PHP application with
AWS RDS, successful automation of the CI/CD pipeline, and positive feedback from the
development community regarding ease of use and security.
